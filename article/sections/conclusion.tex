IterativeCUR is an efficient rank-adaptive method for computing CUR approximations. Because IterativeCUR's reuse of the sketch allows it to form high-quality approximations of matrices with only a small number of matrix vector multiplications, it is exceptionally well suited for forming approximations to large matrices. Additionally, by incorporating risk-aware stopping criteria based on aposteriori estimators, IterativeCUR provides high-probability guarantees of approximation quality that a user can adjust to align with their confidence in their chosen stopping threshold. Further, while previous algorithms such as SVDSketch could only guarantee a relative accuracy of $\sqrt{\epsilon_{\rm mach}}$, IterativeCUR can easily handle tolerances very close to $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$. (This is achieved by directly estimating the norm of the residual, rather than relying on an indirect formula that expresses the error as a difference of two squared norms.)
In experiments, we have shown that IterativeCUR is highly competitive, matching and at times exceeding a state of the art CUR method such as sketched LUPP, both in terms of accuracy and performance. Despite IterativeCUR's strong practical performance, work remains to be done to close the gap between the current conservative theoretical bounds and the observed results.
